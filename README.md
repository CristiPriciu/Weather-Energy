# Weather Energy

Welcome to the Weather Energy App!

This C# program generates a random weather pattern, converts it to MegaWatts of electrical energy from Hydro Electric Power Plants, Solar Farms and Wind Turbines, then turns the MegaWatts into dollars using the current price. 

This is my first C# project. Download and check out the code in Microsoft Visual Studio.
